#Set the path to the input file with all variants that you want to introduce in the cS2G pipeline. 
#The file must consist of at least one column called "Coord" where the chrX:position of each variant in hg19 is supplied(e.g.,chr19:18304700) for European ancestry. 
#When providing fine-mapped variants as input, a second column called "PIP" can also be added.
/path/to/input_file.txt
#Indicate whether the input variants are fine-mapped variants or not (specify YES or NO). NO is set as default.
NO
#Indicate the normalised cS2G score threshold for gene prioritization. It must be a numeric value between 0 and 1. ">0.5" is set as default to be sure that the SNP has only one candidate causal gene (best gene approach).
0.5
##Indicate whether you want to output all the SNP-Gene links (without any filtering). YES is set as default.
YES
