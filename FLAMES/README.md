# Tutorial for running FLAMES on Esrum

FLAMES is a gene prioritization method that builds upon the results from [PoPS](../PoPS/). You can find the official Github [here](https://github.com/Marijn-Schipper/FLAMES), and the preprint [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.23.23300360v2.full).

FLAMES has been made availble as an environment module in the `loos_group-AUDIT` folder on Esrum. This tutorial describes how you can load FLAMES and run it in a script. You can find the tutorial scripts at `/projects/loos_group-AUDIT/data/tutorials/flames_tutorial/`.
