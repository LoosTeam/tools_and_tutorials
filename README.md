# Tools and tutorials

The goal of this repository is to document all the tools made available specifically in the `loos_group-AUDIT` folder on [Esrum](https://cbmr-data.github.io/esrum/). You can find information on the tools and tutorials to run them under the different folders in this repository.

✏️ **_NOTE:_** Please note that you need to be added to the `loos_group-AUDIT` folder on [Esrum](https://cbmr-data.github.io/esrum/) to be able to access and run the tools described in this repository. If you have not already been added to this folder, then [contact me](#contact) for help. 

## How to use the tutorials

Once you have been added to the `loos_group-AUDIT` folder, you will have a personal folder available inside `/projects/loos_group-AUDIT/people/` with your KU username. This folder is only accessible by you, and it is the recommended folder to perform analysis and store data.

You can copy over the scripts from `/projects/loos_group-AUDIT/data/tutorials/` to your personal folder and modify the paths to your files. The paths to tool-specific data do not need to be modified, as this data is stored in a commonly accessible folder i.e., `/projects/loos_group-AUDIT/data/tool_data/`. Please refrain from modifying the original tool data and template scripts.
